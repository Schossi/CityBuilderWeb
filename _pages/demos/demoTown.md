For an in depth breakdown please see the [Manual]({% link _pages/manual/demos/town.md %})  

Buildings are rotated using the __R__ key. The camera is rotated using __Q__ and __E__, use __mouse wheel__ to zoom and __hold shift__ to pitch.

Here is a quick step by step guide for the game: 

- Place the initial Barn and Walkers
- ![Stockpile](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownStockpile.png) Build a new Stockpile so building materials can be stored 
- ![Harvest](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownPick.png) Harvest some Stones and Logs by dragging over Trees and Rocks
- ![House](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownHouse.png) Place a house on the map, walkers will start clearing the ground and delivering materials 
- ![Builder](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownHammer.png) Increase the Builder quantity to one so a walker actually builds the house
- ![Woodcutter](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownWoodcutter.png) A woodcutter can turn Logs into Firewood that keeps walkers from freezing 
- ![Woodcutter](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownAxe.png) Assign woodcutters that will work at the building
- Build one or two additional houses, if food from the initial barn runs out harvest some berries
- ![Field](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownField.png) A properly worked field will yield a large amount of potatoes once a year
- ![Farmer](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownShovel.png) Assign farmers to work the fields
- ![Field](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownForester.png) ![Saw](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownSaw.png) A forester can automatically harvest and replant trees
- ![Field](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownGatherer.png) ![Basket](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownBasket.png) A gatherer can automatically harvest berries without destroying the bush
- ![Market](/assets/images/town/Buildings/TownMarket.png) A market automatically distributes wood and food which decreases downtime from other walkers that have to get materials from the next barn. It needs a road ![Road](/assets/images/town/TownWalker.png) going from the market to the houses which will be followed by the ![Peddler](/assets/images/town/Tools/TownWheelbarrow.png) peddlers.
