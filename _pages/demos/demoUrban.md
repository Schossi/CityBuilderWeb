Build and expand a little town.  
Start small or you'll run out of money before you have steady income.  
  
Money is gained from taxes payed by shops when they refill their stocks.  
The goods for that are brought in by train and distributed by trucks.  
  
Houses send out shoppers that purchase goods from shops.  
They have to be supplied with electricity and power.  
  
Water pumps and power stations have running costs that are billed whenever a train arrives at the station.
